Description: Consider a car approaching a road intersection, the traffic light is green and it
keeps up the speed planning that it will be through. Before that happens, however, the stoplight turns yellow. It needs to be decided to either stop or quickly run through before the light
turns red. The list of main parameters includes:
- Car’s initial speed 20 km/h ≤ v0 ≤ 80 km/h;
- Intial distance to the intersection 10 m ≤ x0 ≤ 150 m;
- Duration of the yellow light 2 s ≤ tyellow ≤ 5 s;
- Intersection’s width 5 m ≤ s ≤ 20 m;
- Magnitude of car’s constant positive acceleration (at accelerated motion) 1 m/s2 ≤ ap ≤
3 m/s2;
- Magnitude of car’s constant negative acceleration (at decelerated motion) 1 m/s2 ≤ an ≤
3 m/s2
.
Tasks:

1. Write an OOP code that implements the concepts of car and road intersection, inputs
the parameters and outputs the suggestion to accelerate or stop.
2. Run the program for different values of the input parameters and prepare a short report
with the discussion how they affect the decision.
3. Draw the distance-time and speed-distance graphs and indicate the prohibited values.
4. Repeat the project assuming bounded maximal speed 50 km/h ≤ Vmax ≤ 100 km/h.
5. Repeat the project assuming two cars approaching the road intersection in the same
direction, where x0 is the distance from the frontal car to the intersection and the
distance between the rear and the frontal cars is 10 m ≤ d ≤ 100 m. Output suggestions
for both cars
